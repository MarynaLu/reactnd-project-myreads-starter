# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Installation and Launch

1. To install the app clone this git repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MarynaLu/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
2. Move to the app folder
$ cd myreads
3. Install dependencies using npm command line tool
$ npm install
4. Run the application
$ npm start
After this, you should see a new browser tab/window with the application running.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
