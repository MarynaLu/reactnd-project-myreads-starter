# MyReads Project

This is the #7 project of the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. This app allows one to select and categorize books one have read, is currently reading, or wants to read.

## Installation and Launch

1. To install the app clone this git repository  
```$ git clone https://github.com/MarynaLu/reactnd-project-myreads-starter```
2. Move to the app folder  
```$ cd myreads```
3. Install dependencies using npm command line tool  
```$ npm install```
4. Run the application  
```$ npm start```

After this, you should see a new browser tab/window with the application running.
